The task is to design the billing system frontend interview.

ISSUES I FACED:
	
	1. I had the confusion in this design was built in the concept of table or Grid system of HTML.

	2. Again, I strucked in the implementation of "rowspan" and "colspan" in table.
	3. There are too many chaos in the "GST SUMMARY" column, that consume major time in this task.


OVERCOMES:
	
	1. I assume this was done by tables and I did it.
	
	2. Neatly, revise up the basics of the table and slowly implement one by one.
	3. Implement n number of ideas, finnaly I got the desired design.
