					The task is to design the "Billing system" front-end.
Advantages:
	1.Advanced CSS and HTML concepts are used in this task.
	2. I have used the concept of table and grid system in this task.
	3. I have used the concept of rowspan and colspan in this task.
	4. I have used the concept of flexbox in this task.
	5. I implemented the design in the mobile responsive manner.
	6. The Table was expanded based on the number of items in the cart.
	7. The GST summary was designed in the table format.
	8. The total amount was calculated based on the number of items in the cart.

ISSUES I FACED:
	
	1. I had the confusion in this design was built in the concept of table or Grid system of HTML.
	2. Again, I strucked in the implementation of "rowspan" and "colspan" in table.
	3. There are too many chaos in the "GST SUMMARY" column, that consume major time in this task.
	4. I had the confusion in the implementation of the "TOTAL AMOUNT" column.


OVERCOMES:
	
	1. I assume this was done by tables and I did it.
	2. Neatly, revise up the basics of the table and slowly implement one by one.
	3. Implement n number of ideas, finnaly I got the desired design.
